 => it helps to link local and remote repo


14.git push -u origin main
 git push=>uploads your code to github
 -u=>this tracks your local branch upstream with remote
 origin=> alias name for remote(github)
 main=> Remote "main" branch
 =>It is used to push the file in git

 15.git branch -D "branch-name"
  =>this code is used to delete branch

 16. git clone <ssh link>

 Significance of -u(tracking the upstream) is that we can write only "git push" from next time onward. otherwise , we should write 
 "git push origin main" everytime
