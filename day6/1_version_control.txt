What is version control?
=> There can be different version of thr same project which should be backward compatible.
=> These different version of the same project is maintained by the version control system
=> There are different version control systems like git, mercurial etc. Git is the most famous one.




why to use version control system??
=> To maintain project versions effectively and with less manual work.
=> For effective team collaboration.


=>The project maintained with version control system is later updated somewhere in the cloud.
=> There are several cloud storage services like google drive, onedrive, s3. But these storage system donot cooperate with version control
 (e.g. git)
=> so we should use such cloud services which unnderstand version control. There are several such services 
for example, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc.
