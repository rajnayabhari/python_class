# we may have different projects  in our system that may require different package dependencies
# your project may have pandas version 2.1 whereas project2 may havr pandas version 2.5 in the same system
# so this arises a problem . I fyou want to work on project1 
then one of the packages must be uninstalled from your global system and another version must be installed 

# this probelm can be solved creating a virtual environment in your system
# virtual environment is an isolated environment to keep the packages required for your project
# it solves the problem of installing and uninstalling packages for different projects in a same system

# every pyhton project must be done with a virtual environment activity

///pypi bata package haru install garne tya bata pip install wala copy garneanih terminal ma run garne
