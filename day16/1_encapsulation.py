# encapsulation is the process of data hiding in oop
# we can make the attributes private,public, and protected

# protected members of a class are meant be used within a class or in their children class only
# they are not meant to be used outside class
# python is not strict in oop approach so it allows protected members to be accessed even outside the class.
# but it is not recommended for developers as it doesnt follow proper convention

# private property is not accessible outside the class or in their children
# print(v1.__milage) ## attribute error
print(dir(v1)) # kun kun class ko access garna milxa dekhauxa
print(v1._Vehicle__milage)  #yesari garda private element lai ni access garna milxa

# though __milage is a private property , we can access it using '_Vehicle__milage'
# it is also called "name mangling" in python
