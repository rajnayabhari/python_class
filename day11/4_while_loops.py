# while loops is another way to loop in pyhton. "while" takes a statement after it and the loop runs 
# until the statement is truthy. It stops immediately on getting falsy statement

# n=0
# while n<=10:
#     print(n)#this condition starts infinite loop because n is not updated
    
n=0
while n<=10:
    print(n)
    n+=1

# while True:
#     print("hello") #this also starts infinite loop because true value present
