# Set in Python are mutable data type. However, every elemnt of set should be Immutable
# set doesn't support indexing and slicing
# set element are always unique
# Sets are unordered . {1,2} and {2,1} are same


# Creating an empty set

a= set()
# a={} #This is not an empty set. It's an empty dictionary

# Creating n non-empty set
data={1,2,3,4}
fruits={"apple","banana","mango"}
a={1,"a",(1,2),2.2}
print(a)
a={[1,2],2}  #This is not a valid set because list are mutable
